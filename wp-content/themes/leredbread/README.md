# Project 5 - Le Red Bread Bakery Custom Wordpress Theme

## Project Summary
We built a Wordpress site, Le Red Bread Bakery, using a custom theme with the RED Starter Theme as a base.  We leveraged WP template hierarchy to generate the layouts for the website.  This included a home page, about page, products page and blog, as well as single product pages and blog posts, contact page, 404 page and search page.  We included a widgetized area in the sidebar where the user can populate custom business hours and created a custom taxonomy for for "Product Type" inside of a functionality plugin.  For the Menu, we configured a WP menu through the WP admin interface.

## Tools Used
- Wordpress
  - Template hierarchy, template tags
  - Plugins, Widgets, Menus, Pages, Posts
  - Hooks, actions, filters
- PHP for Wordpress
- MAMP for local development

## Experiences

Learning how to use Wordpress, especially building a custom theme, has been a fun, and at times challenging, experience. While it took awhile to understand the template hierarchy and how PHP for Wordpress works, I feel like I am getting more comfortable navigating the Wordpress workflow and debugging when I hit a roadblock.  I am looking forward to building more sites with WP in the future.
